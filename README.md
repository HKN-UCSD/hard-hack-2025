# HARD Hack 2024

H.A.R.D. Hack is a hardware hackathon that HKN holds annually in collaboration with IEEE and Triton Neurotech. We provide the materials and the tools needed to make a hardware hack. Come out and build something cool! Anyone can attend, regardless of skill level, major, or university. Group up into teams of 4 and compete with your fellow engineering students overnight. Food will be provided!

Top builds that align with the project theme will earn a prize! In previous years, winning teams have won speakers, mice, and other fun tech.

# Development
To build new html elements, create files in `templates` folder
To 'compile' and build a website using these html files, run `python hardhack.py`
The reason for this is so that we do not have to manually put the same header inside every file. The python script will inject these header elements for us.

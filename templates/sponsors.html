    text="H.A.R.D. Hack is San Diego’s largest hardware-focused hackathon.<br />
    It is hosted annually by <b>IEEE</b>, <b>Eta Kappa Nu (HKN)</b>, and <b>TNT</b> at UC San Diego, H.A.R.D. Hack provides college students with a wide range of hardware components and challenges teams to build projects under 24 hours that can make real-life impacts."

    header="Why Hard Hack?"
    text="“SOFTWARE COMES FROM HEAVEN WHEN YOU HAVE GOOD HARDWARE” - KEN OLSEN<br /><br /> 
    Gordon Moore made an insightful observation that defined the trajectory of modern digital transformation. Decades over, drastic growth in computer chips’ performances paved the way for the rapid development of life-changing technologies, including wireless communications, autonomous driving, and artificial intelligence. However, as the software industry continues to boom, many students interested in hardware felt overshadowed in most hackathons.<br /><br />
    At H.A.R.D. Hack, we aim to provide our participants with a wide variety of advanced hardware components and high-quality community support, so that our next generation of engineers will better master system integration skills. Students from multidisciplinary backgrounds collaborate to develop projects by integrating hardware and software to address real-life issues. Our projects in the past include TrashBot that collects recycled bottles autonomously and EasyCare that assigns tasks based on the patient’s brain waves.<br /><br />
